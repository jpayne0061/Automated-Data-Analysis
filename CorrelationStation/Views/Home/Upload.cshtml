<h1>Upload a CSV File</h1>

<p class="js-show-next pointer">How does this work?</p>
<p class="no-show how-does-it-work">
    CSV Analyzer is a tool that helps you find associations and correlations between variables/columns in your csv file.
    <br />
    <br />
    After you upload a csv file, you will be prompted to identify each column as either categorical, Date Time or numeral(currently, these are the only variable types the app supports).
    You also have the option of giving your report a name and description.
    <br/>
    <br />
    After you prepare your report, CSV Analyzer will run statistical tests and/or produce data visualizations on each of the columns/variables
    that you have selected. Depending on the variable types, CSV Analyzer may run an Anova test, Chi-squared test or Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
